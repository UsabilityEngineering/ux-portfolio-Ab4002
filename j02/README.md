The Nintendo DS was the biggest buzz in the gaming world because of its revolutionary user experience with UX. For example, the DS featured a novel folding dual-screen and changed the console store games for the user to start playing the console.


When the user opens the console, the Nintendo DS but they open the console they have to put in store the game into the back of the Nintendo DS.  This Task is exceptionally easy to use and highly **efficient** to get from the Gamestop store from the video game shop. On the side of the Nintendo DS next to the power button, there is a section where you put the pen of the Nintendo DS. The pen section is useful for the user to not lose the pen when there are going to be using the Nintendo DS for games and don’t want to use the arrows buttons. The Nintendo DS has a special feature where you can chat with other friends on the console it was more like texting but in a **safe** way, where parents can also have control of the console. The Nintendo DS Chat was a very **satisfying** feature to have cause you can see how the kids are still having fun with it even if they aren’t playing games on it. 

However, the user experience can sometimes be not perfect. Powering it on to play a game but the game isn’t in right so it throws the error screen, then you open to play the game but see you have a message from a friend and so you message them, and then you play your game notice how the pen can be nice to use with the game.It is cool that it does have that feature of error but it does get frustrating once in a while. 

Overall, the Nintendo DS was such a fun console to have. It was a **memorable** technology to have when you were younger cause you got to connect with everything who had this console at the time. If you had one, you were basically considered a popular kid. The Nintendo DS is a useful technology console that I will have my kids use in the future.
