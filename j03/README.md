The Pinterest web application is a great example of a user experience with the different kinds of features it provides. With a lot of images at once, performing otherwise when wanting to look at the image details it's so hard to get the information you need for each image.

When a user is trying to attempt a  topic they would like on Pinterest, it is **useful** for the user to have many options on the topic they are researching. It is very **satisfying** to see how the user has many images to choose from. **Effectiveness** determines how well the user is trying to accomplish the task when trying to figure out which button to use and where it is at in the interface in order to save their image into their profile. This interface is such a **learnability** and **efficiency** way to understand the concept of how to save an image to your profile page. I think that if they get rid of the data for each image it would be less overwhelmed when it comes to knowing what the website is all about. 

Overall, it seems like Pinterest never adds new features or deletes the old ones. The interface does have a lack of **effectiveness**, but it is a useful and **safe** website for users who need something creative to work on. **Learnable** site to see how each user uses it in their own way. Pinterest is a **useful** website that will always have users using the site at all times. Great interface to work with when it comes to using user experience.
